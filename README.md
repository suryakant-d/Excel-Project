## 📝 Project Overview

1. **Data Acquisition**  
   - Imported daily call/chat logs (`.xlsx`) from AstroSage’s CRM.

2. **Data Transformation & Modeling**  
   - Cleaned and normalized agent, consultation‑type, platform and timestamp fields.  
   - Built pivot tables for volume, status breakdown, guru‑level metrics, and revenue by category.

3. **Dashboard Design**  
   - **High‑Level KPIs:**  
     - Avg. Daily Consultations (824), Agents/Day (4), Consults/Agent (206), Total Earnings (₹99K), Revenue (₹214K), Profit (₹115K).  
   - **Consultation Mix & Status:**  
     - Chat vs Call volume, completion/failure rates, “No‑answer” metrics.  
   - **Platform Distribution:**  
     - Web (“Gurucool” 72%), App 28%, Dashboard <1%.  
   - **Guru Performance:**  
     - Top‑rated vs top‑consulted astrologers.  
   - **Temporal Trends:**  
     - Daily volumes (Dec ’23–Jan ’24) and hourly call‑volume heatmap.  
   - **Revenue by Category:**  
     - Breakdown by session‑type (call‑length tiers, complimentary vs paid).

4. **Key Insights**  
   - **Peak Load:** 12 PM–8 PM drives 70% of traffic → staffing focus.  
   - **Platform Focus:** Web UI dominates; app improvements could lift engagement.  
   - **Top Gurus:** Balance high‑rating with high‑volume advisors for quality and capacity.  
   - **Monetization Gaps:** “0”‑ and mid‑tier sessions under‑monetized; upsell strategies needed.

5. **Actionable Recommendations**  
   - **Staff scheduling** around peak hours to reduce “no‑answer.”  
   - **Enhance web experience** (72% of sessions) with A/B tested UI tweaks.  
   - **Incentivize top‑rating, high‑volume gurus** through tiered commission.  
   - **Upsell mid‑tier sessions** and convert “0”‑revenue slots into short‑paid offers.
   - Integrate AI-powered call routing and sentiment analysis to efficiently balance high daily call volumes per agent.
